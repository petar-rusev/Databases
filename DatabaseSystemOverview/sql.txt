SQL is relational database management system.
SQL is short for Structured Query Language.
SQL supports distributed databases, offering users great flexibility.
Users can create and delete databases, as well as set permissions on database tables, views and procedures. 
It also allows users to manipulate the data within a database.

In SQL, there are two main sets of commands that are used to create and modify databases. 
These are the Data Definition Language and the Data Manipulation Language

SQL language is divided into several elements: clauses, expressions, predicates, queries and statements. 
SQL queries are the most essential and common SQL operations. 
SQL query helps users retrieve needed data from a database, and it is executed using the ‘Select’ statement.

SELECT  FirstName, LastName, City 
WHERE City = 'London'

Will return firstName, larstName and city of people who leaves in “London”
