What is NoSQL?

NoSQL encompasses a wide variety of different database technologies that were developed in response to a rise in the volume of data stored about users,
 objects and products, the frequency in which this data is accessed, and performance and processing needs. Relational databases, on the other hand, were 
 not designed to cope with the scale and agility challenges that face modern applications, nor were they built to take advantage of the cheap storage and 
 processing power available today.
 
Examples for the NoSQL Databases:
-MongoDB
-BaseX
-Cloudant
-Clusterpoint
-CouchbaseServer
-ApacheCouchDB
-Solr
-Elasticsearch
-eXist
-Jackrabbit
-IBM Notes and IBM Domino
-MarkLogic Server
-Oracle NoSQL Database
