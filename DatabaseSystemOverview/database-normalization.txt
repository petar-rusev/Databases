Normalization of the relational schema removes repeating data
Normalization has four normal  forms.
1) Data is stored in tables
Fields in the rows are atomic  values
There are no repetitions within a single row
A primary key is defined for each table
2) Retains all requirements of 1-st Normal Form 
There are no columns that do not depend on part of the primary key (if it consists of several columns)
3) Retains all requirements of 2-nd Normal Form
The only dependencies between columns are of type "a column depends on the PK"
4) Retains all requirements of 3-rd Normal Form
There is one column at most in each table that can have many possible values for a single key 

Advantages of normalized are:
Searching, sorting, and creating indexes is faster, since tables are narrower, and more rows fit on a data page.
You can have more clustered indexes (one per table), so you get more flexibility in tuning queries.
More tables allow better use of segments to control physical placement of data.
You usually have fewer indexes per table, so data modification commands are faster.
Fewer null values and less redundant data, making your database more compact.
Triggers execute more quickly if you are not maintaining redundant data.
Data modification anomalies are reduced.
Normalization is conceptually cleaner and easier to maintain and change as your needs change.
