A transaction comprises a unit of work performed within a database management system. 
They treated in a coherent and reliable way independent of other transactions. 
A transaction generally represents any change in database.
Transactions in a database environment have two main purposes:
-To provide reliable units of work that allow correct recovery from failures and keep a database consistent even in cases of system failure, when execution stops (completely or partially) and many operations upon a database remain uncompleted, with unclear status.
-To provide isolation between programs accessing a database concurrently. If this isolation is not provided, the program's outcome are possibly erroneous.

ACID = Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability
