 An RDBMS is a DBMS which manages a relational database. A relational database stores data in tables. Tables are organized
 into columns, and each column stores one type of data (integer, real number, character strings, date, …).  The data for a single 
 “instance” of a table is stored as a row.  For example, the Customer table would have columns such as CustomerNumber, FirstName, and Surname, 
 and a row within that table would be something like {1701, “James”, “Kirk”}.
 
 The most common use of RDBMSs is to implement simple CRUD – Create, Read, Update, and Delete – functionality.  For example an application could
 create a new order and insert it into your database. It could read an existing order, work with the data, and then update the database with the new information. 
 It could also choose to delete an existing order, perhaps because the customer has cancelled it.  The vast majority of your interaction with an RDB will 
 likely be to implement basic CRUD functionality.
