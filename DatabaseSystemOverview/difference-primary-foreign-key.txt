
A primary key is a special relational database table column (or combination of columns) designated to uniquely identify all table records.
A primary keyâ€™s main features are:
    It must contain a unique value for each row of data.
    It cannot contain null values.
A primary key is either an existing table column or a column that is specifically generated by the database according to a defined sequence.

In the context of relational databases, a foreign key is a field (or collection of fields) in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table.
[1][2][3] In simpler words, the foreign key is defined in a second table, but it refers to the primary key in the first table. For example, a table 
called Employee has a primary key called employee_id. Another table called Employee Details has a foreign key which references employee_id in order to 
uniquely identify the relationship between both the tables.
The table containing the foreign key is called the referencing or child table, and the table containing the candidate key is called the referenced or parent table

Primary keys enforce uniqueness on the column(s) of one table, foreign keys define a 
relationship between two tables. A foreign key identifies a column or group of columns in one (referencing) table
that refers to a column or group of columns in another (referenced) table.
