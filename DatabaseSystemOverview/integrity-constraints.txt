Intergrity constrains means something like 'be right' and consistent. The data in a database must be right and in good condition.
There are the domain integrity, the entity integrity, the referential integrity and the foreign key integrity constraints.

Domain integrity means the definition of a valid set of values for an attribute. You define 
- data type, 
- lenght or size
- is null value allowed
- is the value unique or not
for an attribute.
The entity integrity constraint states that primary keys can't be null. There must be a proper value in the primary key field.
The referential integrity constraint is specified between two tables and it is used to maintain the consistency among rows between the two tables.

The rules are:
1. You can't delete a record from a primary table if matching records exist in a related table.
2. You can't change a primary key value in the primary table if that record has related records.
3. You can't enter a value in the foreign key field of the related table that doesn't exist in the primary key of the primary table.
4. However, you can enter a Null value in the foreign key, specifying that the records are unrelated.

Foreign Key Integrity Constraint
There are two foreign key integrity constraints: cascade update related fields and cascade delete related rows. These constraints affect the referential integrity constraint.
